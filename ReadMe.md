# SpringCQRS Project: Professional Development Journey

Welcome to the **SpringCQRS** project‚Äîa comprehensive initiative designed to master advanced concepts in Java backend engineering and modern software architecture. This repository is not just a codebase, but a learning journey and a showcase of best practices in building scalable, secure, and maintainable systems.

## üöÄ Project Vision
To architect and implement a robust, production-ready backend system leveraging the latest patterns, tools, and methodologies in the Java ecosystem. The goal is to gain hands-on expertise in:

- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** Designing and implementing reliable, decoupled read/write models for high-performance systems.
- **MongoDB:** Building scalable, resilient NoSQL data stores and understanding advanced data modeling techniques.
- **DevOps:** Containerization with Docker & Docker Compose, orchestration with Kubernetes (K8s), and infrastructure as code.
- **CI/CD:** Automating build, test, and deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions, Terraform, and Helm for seamless delivery.
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) & SOLID Principles:** Crafting maintainable, modular, and business-aligned codebases.
- **API Resilience:** Implementing rate limiting, retry patterns, and circuit breakers to ensure fast, secure, and reliable APIs.
- **Security:** Integrating enterprise-grade authentication and authorization with Keycloak, OAuth2, JWT, and RBAC.

## üìö Continuous Learning
This project is fueled by ongoing research and study of industry-leading resources, including:

- *Domain-Driven Design* by Eric Evans
- *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* by Martin Kleppmann
- Technical articles, whitepapers, and community best practices

## üèÜ Objectives
- Deliver a reference implementation of CQRS and DDD in a real-world Java Spring application
- Demonstrate end-to-end DevOps automation and cloud-native deployment
- Showcase secure, scalable, and maintainable backend architecture
- Document key learnings, design decisions, and implementation patterns

## üí° Why This Project?
- To bridge the gap between theory and practice in modern backend engineering
- To build a portfolio-quality system that reflects current industry standards
- To contribute to the open-source community and help others on a similar journey
